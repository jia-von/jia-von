### TL;DR ðŸ˜Š
Bonjour! My interest in Linux started on December 2020, when I was introduced to my first Raspberry Pi 4. That Christmas gift changed my view and relationship with computers forever. I have been exploring and engaging with Linux and Open Source Software ever since. 

### Languages
- Python
- Java
- Javascript - HTML - CSS - PHP - SQL
- Bash Shell Scripting

### Projects
I love building, testing, and tinkering with software and hardwares. I truly enjoy the essence of programming itself and it brings me joy. It is odd but I just like coding regardless of stack, framework, or language.
